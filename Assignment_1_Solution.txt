Solution 1 :-

* - Expression(Multiplication)
'hello' - Value(String)
-87.8 - Value(Float)
- - Expression(Subtraction)
/ - Expression(Division)
+ - Expression (Addition)
6 - Value (Integer)


Solution 2 :-

string - it is type of data. We can also say it is sequence  of characters.
variable - it is used to store some value.
Ex:- x="akshay"  ---> here x is a variable and "akshay" is a string


Solution 3 :-

3 type of data type are:-
1. Text type - str
2. Numeric type - int,float
3. Boolean type - bool


Solution 4 :-


Expressions are made up of mathematical operations. They do some sort of calculation.


Solution 5 :-

Statement is a type of command like print statement and assignment statement.
expression is some sort of mathematical operation.
Ex.
spam=10
b=spam*10
Here spam*10 is expression where as assigning its value to variable b is statement(b=spam*10).


Solution 6 :-

code:
bacon = 22
bacon + 1
Variable bacon will still contain value 22 after running this code.


Solution 7 :-

value of following terms would be :
'spam'+'spamspam' = 'spamspamspam'
'spam'*3 = 'spamspamspam'


Solution 8 :-

Egg is valid variable name and 100 is not because variable name always starts with letter(A-Z,a-z) or underscore.


Solution 9 :-

To get integer version of value - int(value)
To get floating point version of value - float(value)
To get string version of value - str(value)


Solution 10 :-

'I have eaten'+ 99 + 'burritos'
This expression is causing an error because we can't do concatination of string with integer.
To solve the problem we have a string method called format
'I have eaten {} burritos'.format(99)
